Installation
------------

#### morphoBlocks

You can install `morphoBlocks` directly within *R* using the `install_github()` function from the [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) package:

``` r
install_github("aharmer/morphoBlocks", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Depending on your setup, you may also need to install *Rtools* first. If you need *Rtools* you will get an error message during `morphoBlocks` installation. Just install *Rtools* then reinstall `morphoBlocks`.
